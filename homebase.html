          <p>
          <strong>The Opportunity</strong>
          <br />
          Payroll adoption is the biggest path for growth, but business owners rarely think about Homebase for payroll, and the set up process is arduous. It’s the stickiest feature, it allows revenue for freemium customers as an add-on, and adds major value to both businesses and their employees (time saved + cash advances).
        </p>
          <p class="mar-bot--40"><strong>The Challenge</strong>
          <br />
      		Can we drive more business owners to us <u>before</u> choosing a payroll provider and shorten time to payroll run for those ready to use our payroll? Can we make this feel magical? Can we change their behavior to start with payroll setup?</p>

              <strong>Research &amp; Discovery:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul class="mar-bot--40">
              <li><strong>Pair with Customer Support and Sales:</strong> Weekly syncs with team leads, listening to Gong calls, sifting through Help tickets.</li>
              <li><strong>35 customer calls:</strong> I led calls with successful and unsuccessful payroll customers to understand their journey from idea to a paid team</li>
              <li><strong>300+ survey responses:</strong> To gain more confidence, I scaled learnings with a few surveys</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="tldr body mar-bot--40">
	          <li><strong>Payroll is a business milestone, not just another feature.</strong> It became clear from my research that customers went with what they knew: an accountant or software they had heard of (Quickbooks, etc.).</li>

            <p>
              <strong>Ideation & Prototyping</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ideation:</strong> Working with Sales and through my customer calls, I got initial validation on the idea we wanted to build towards.</li>
              <li><strong>Wireframing &amp; Prototyping:</strong> I tested a few flows using moderated and unmoderated sessions in Maze to understand what resonated most, and felt like it added the most value (and magic).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Happy path elevated with AI ✨</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Removing 80% of set up:</strong> We knew the biggest dropoffs in their set up process, and designed an AI-assisted workflow to make this feel magical.</li>
              <li><strong>Finding the right time:</strong> We felt confident we could do this in the current payroll set up flow, but wanted to get as upfunnel as possible.</li>
              <li><strong>Changing behaviors:</strong> Another goal was learning if we could change the behavior of these customers to commit and start payroll first.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- <p>
              <strong>Final Design</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The finished design was focused around getting as many new customers to a baseline good profile as quickly and efficiently as possible. It was also based on being clear enough to add/edit your profile any time you saw fit, and to drive more usage of deeper features. I also designed this with smart defaults.</li>
              <li><strong>Visual Design:</strong> Starting with the design system, I created all the atoms (colors and typography), then built up into molecules (form components, text components, interaction definitions, badge, etc.) and page layouts. This helped for visual consistency and clarity, and also helped engineering work quickly and focus less on the UI and more the UX.</li>

              <strong>Results &amp; Impact</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Payroll runs increased ~700%:</strong> For customers in the test, who went through the full flow, they ran payroll at an astonishlingly higher rate.</li>
              <li><strong>PQLs increased ~500%:</strong> We shortened the time to becoming a payroll-qualified lead (i.e. showing payroll intent in the product) from ~35 minutes to ~4 minutes. This also sped up the connections our payroll sales team was able to make with this high-intent customers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Lessons Learned/Challenges</strong>
              <br />
              For customers in the experiment, changing the narrative for them to be all around payroll, i.e. getting ready to pay your team for the first time, was effective at helping change their behavior to starting with payroll first. Not having access to the document at this time was a known risk, and we have work ready to go to allow this later in the experience, but asking for this right away did not have any negative impact even if I did not start with payroll setup right away. Removing the hard parts of payroll setup with this experience clearly helps interested customers stay on track and motivated to finish asap.

              <strong>Key Takeaways</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Learnings:</strong> We discovered a lot of high-value concepts in the design process, but ruthlessly prioritized and held true to the goal of making the product simpler and more efficient, which would help drive long-term adoption.</li>
              <li><strong>Improvements:</strong> We could have scoped this down a lot more from the get-go and released this sooner, however, the ideation process was also valuable for building the future roadmap out. The design system was the biggest hurdle but also the most valuable in the future for increasing velocity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mar-bot--40">
              <strong>Conclusion</strong>
              <br />
              The saas product is the main source of value for our customers (i.e. where they set up and run their businesses from) and by not making it more efficient, we were leaving thousands of dollars on the table through wasted sales efforts and churn. The design system was made specifically for our less-than-tech savvy customers, prioritized clarity and simplicity, and improved on critical workflows for maximizing our most important KPI, bookings.
