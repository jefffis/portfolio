            <h2 class="heading--lite mar-bot--8">I had the pleasure of working with Jeff as our first designer at Thriveworks. He’s the most passionate designer I’ve worked with. He cares about the problems, he cares about the users. Jeff's a great utility knife, running user research, putting together prototypes, wireframes, and even coding front-end as-needed. If you’re looking for a lean, mean, high-velocity design machine, it’s Jeff!! His breadth of perspectives enables him with an intuitive and valuable sense for balancing speed, scope, business value, customer value, risk, and quality when iterating and creating software.</h2>

I highly recommend Jeff for any project that requires top-notch UI design skills, especially in Figma.</h2>
